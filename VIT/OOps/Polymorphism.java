// 3. Polymorphism (One Interface, Many Forms)
// ðŸ”¹ Real-Life Example: Vehicles (Car, Bike, Truck)
// Imagine a driver using different types of vehicles:

// A car runs on 4 wheels

// A bike runs on 2 wheels

// A truck runs on 6+ wheels

// Regardless of the type, the driver uses the same "Drive" action, but the behavior changes based on the vehicle.
